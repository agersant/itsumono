This library is a collection of utilities for Haxe game development built with three principles in mind:

* Elegant API, itsumono utilities only do what their names say and are very simple to use.
* Highly-flexible, itsumono is designed to work with *your* data formats and *your* classes.
* Loose coupling, itsumono does not have a main loop and the utilities are vastly independant from one another.

#Setup Instructions
Assuming you have installed Haxe and Haxelib is in your system's path, run

    haxelib git itsumono https://github.com/agersant/itsumono master src/
    
If your project uses [OpenFL](https://github.com/openfl/openfl), add ```<haxelib name="itsumono" />``` to your *application.xml* file. Otherwise, add "-lib itsumono" to your project's compilation flags. In [FlashDevelop](http://flashdevelop.org/), this can be done by clicking *Project* > *Propertiesâ€¦* > *Compiler Options* > *Libraries* and adding "itsumono" on a blank line. That's it, you can now use as many (or as few) itsumono utilities as you want in your project.
